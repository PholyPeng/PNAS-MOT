# KITTI Devkit

This devkit includes the code to evaluate the MOT results.
We borrow the original evaluation code provided by the [KITTI MOT Benchmark](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_tracking.php) with small modification of the function API.
This guarantees our evaluation to be consistent with the official benchmark.

These `segmaps` from the original devkit are put in the `data/tracking` directory.
